Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (id); 8090 (business_id); 9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id), 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 593 (user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	No

    +-------------+-------------+----------------+

    As a result of the following code:

    select review_count
           ,count(*) as total_users
           ,avg(fans) as avg_fan_base     
    from (select case  
                 when review_count between 0 and 100 then '0 - 100'
                 when review_count between 100 and 500 then '100 - 500'
                 else '500+' end as review_count,
                 review_count, 
                 fans
          from user) as distribution
    group by distribution.review_count

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

    --> I choose 'Las Vegas' as city and 'Restaurant' as category
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

  The business with 2-3 stars have opening hours from 11 am to 0.00 pm, while with 4-5 stars have two 
 types of opening hours, from 11 am to 08 pm and from 10 am to 11 pm.

    SQL code used for analysis:

        select case when stars between 4 and 5  then '4-5 stars'
                    when stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3 stars'
                    else 'Others' end as rate,
                    hours
        from business
        inner join category
        on business.id = category.business_id
        inner join hours
        on hours.business_id = category.business_id                  
        where business.city = 'Las Vegas' and category.category = 'Restaurants'
    
    And here is the results:
        +-----------+-----------------------+
        | rate      | hours                 |
        +-----------+-----------------------+
        | 4-5 stars | Monday|11:00-20:00    |
        | 4-5 stars | Tuesday|11:00-20:00   |

        | 4-5 stars | Sunday|10:00-23:00    |
        | 4-5 stars | Saturday|10:00-23:00  |
        +-----------+-----------------------+
    
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
     
     The '2-3' group have less number of reviews than the '4-5' group.

    SQL code used for analysis:

        select case when stars between 4 and 5  then '4-5 stars'
                when stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3 stars'
                else 'Others' end as rate,
                review_count
        from business
        inner join category
        on business.id = category.business_id
        inner join hours
        on hours.business_id = category.business_id                  
        where business.city = 'Las Vegas' and category.category = 'Restaurants'
        group by rate

    And here is the results:
    
    +-----------+--------------+
    | rate      | review_count |
    +-----------+--------------+
    | 2-3 stars |          123 |

    +-----------+--------------+    
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

    All of the '4-5' stars restaurants are located in summerlin or in china town.

    SQL code used for analysis:

        select case when stars between 4 and 5  then '4-5 stars'
                    when stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3 stars'

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
   The opened business have far more reviews numbers than the closed ones.
        
        +------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
        | open_close | Total number of reviews | Total number of business |
        +------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
        | closed     |                   35261 |                     1520 |
        | opened     |                  269300 |                     8480 |
        +------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
      
         
ii. Difference 2:
    The number of closed business is less than the opened business (about 15%  in total).

        +------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
        | open_close | Total number of reviews | Total number of business |
        +------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
        | closed     |                   35261 |                     1520 |
        | opened     |                  269300 |                     8480 |
        +------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+     
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

        select  case when is_open = 1 then 'opened'
                    when is_open = 0 then 'closed'
                    end as open_close,
                sum(review_count) 'Total number of reviews',

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   Trying to predict the stars based on the sentimental analysis of review text.      
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
   For this analysis, we'll need a database consisted mainly of:
   - A column of unique id per comment or review.
   - A column of the review or comment text
   - A column of number of stars which the business is --- on,
   The Yelp database provide a table called review wich consisted of the required data.                     
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

| ----X0BIDP9tA49U3RvdSQ | Red, white and bleu salad was super yum and a great addition to the menu! This location was clean with great service and food served at just the right temps! Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos! When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again! |     4 |
